# Project Rules

## Git Commits
- NEVER add "Co-Authored-By" or any co-author attribution in commit messages
- Write concise commit messages in English
- Use conventional commit style when appropriate (feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, chore)

## Code Style
- Keep it simple. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no build tools, no frameworks
- Use CDNs for external libraries (Three.js, GSAP)
- All text content must support EN/ES via data-en and data-es attributes

## Project Context
- This is a GitHub Pages portfolio site for Danilo Díaz Tarascó
- Deployed at ddtdanilo.github.io from the master branch
- The repo must stay **public** for GitHub Pages to work (free plan)

## Privacy
- NEVER include personal phone numbers or email addresses in the codebase
- Contact should be directed through LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/ddtdanilo)
